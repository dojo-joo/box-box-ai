# 🏁 box-box-ai

**box-box-ai** is an AI-powered system that automatically generates detailed and insightful reports of Formula 1 races using data from the [OpenF1 API](https://www.openf1.org/). The goal of this project is to combine my passion for **Formula 1** and **Artificial Intelligence** into a tool that can make F1 data more accessible, engaging, and useful for fans, analysts, and enthusiasts.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is in its early stages — I'm still exploring the best architecture and technologies to use.  
My **first task** is to define the key features I want to build and create a clear **roadmap** for development.

## 🔧 What to Expect (Eventually)

- Automated summaries and race reports  
- Driver and team performance analysis  
- Natural language querying of the OpenF1Api
- Integration with the OpenF1 API for live and historical data  

## 🤝 Contributing

I'm building this in the open and would love your help!  
Feel free to:
- Open **issues** to suggest features, improvements, or ideas  
- Help brainstorm or validate the project direction  
- Share feedback on race report structure or presentation  

## 💬 Why box-box-ai?

*"Box, box!"* is a familiar phrase to F1 fans — a perfect blend of tech and racing. This project aims to reflect that same spirit by fusing real-world motorsport data with AI capabilities.
